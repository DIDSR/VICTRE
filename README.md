# VICTRE
Virtual Imaging Clinical Trial for Regulatory Evaluation

Clinical trails are expensive and delay the regulatory evaluation and early patient access to novel devices. In order to demonstrate an alternative approach, a recent effort at the Division of Imaging, Diagnostics, and Software Reliability at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (known as the VICTRE project) demonstrated the replication of one such clinical trial using completely in-silico tools and compared results in terms of imaging modality performance between the human trial and the computational trial. The VICTRE trial consisted in imaging 3000 digital breast models in digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis system models. On this page we are making all the in silico components of VICTRE freely available to the community, and also sharing the entire VICTRE pipeline as a container which can be run either on locally or in the cloud.
