# VICTRE - ROI Extraction
*Author: Diksha Sharma (US Food and Drug Administration)*

This code extracts the regions of interest (ROIs) for both, lesion-present and lesion-absent mammography projection images (or volumes of interest (VOIs) from the DBT volumes). For extracting lesion-absent ROIs, we applied rigorous checks including whether the subimages are within the reconstructed volume boundaries and non-overlapping, to find the appropriate locations.

Folder contents
---------------
- Source codes - roiExtraction_mammo_SA.py (mammo signal absent), roiExtraction_mammo_SP.py (mammo signal present), roiExtraction_DBT_FBP_SA.py (DBT signal absent), roiExtraction_DBT_FBP_SP.py (DBT signal present).
- build/*.sh - bash scripts for execution
- README_roiextraction.md - this file

Pre-requisites
--------------
- Python - this code has been tested on Python 2.7.5.
- Needs (some of) the following inputs depending on the code to run: phantom raw file pc/pcl_SEED_crop.raw.gz (This SEED is unique to each phantom and is used as the initial random seed for phantom generation. We use this SEED to indicate which phantom to process), MC-GPU projection output (as .raw), flatfield projection output (as .raw).
- Output: ROIs (as .raw), ROI locations file (as .loc).  VOIs are output from roiExtraction_DBT_FBP_SA/SP.py (roiDBT_SA/SP_*_3D.raw).

Execution
---------
- The build/ folder contains scripts for execution - each script requires the phantom seed number (taken from its filename; this seed number is unique per phantom and thus determines which phantom to run) to be provided; user must modify other input arguments for their runs accordingly.
- The user needs to edit the path to input and output files (such as path to phantom raw image, potential lesion locations file, MC-GPU projection raw image, flatfield raw image, folder where extracted ROIs and their locations will be saved) in the source codes and build scripts.

Visualization of ROI/VOIs
-------------------------
The outputs are .raw files which can be visualized in any supporting tool. Image format - Mammo ROIs are in 32-bit real, little-endian byte order; DBT ROI/VOIs are in 64-bit real, little-endian byte order format.

One of the popular tools which can be used is ImageJ. 

ImageJ Example: 
	
		Visualizing Mammo ROIs containing microcalcification (ran with default parameters):

		Image type = 32-bit real
		Width = 65
		Height = 65
		Offset to first image = 0
		Number of images = 1
		Gap between images = 0
		Little-endian byte order - CHECKED
		
		
		Visualizing DBT VOI containing spiculated mass (ran with default parameters):
		
		Image type = 64-bit real
		Width = 109
		Height = 109
		Offset to first image = 0
		Number of images = 9
		Gap between images = 0
		Little-endian byte order - CHECKED
